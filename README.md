> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL FORK** — This is an experimental fork of [Dortania's OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) that attempts to add **T2 Mac support** (MacBook Air 2018/2019). These changes are **not** officially supported and may cause kernel panics or other issues. Use at your own risk.

## T2 Mac Support — Status

> **🚧 Experimental — MacBookAir8,1 / 8,2 (MacBook Air 2018/2019). Not ready for general use.**

- [x] USB boot entry appears in the T2 Startup Manager (`EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi`)
- [x] Kext injection on Sequoia (AMFIPass for the Max-OS = Sonoma bypass)
- [x] **SEP / AppleKeyStore "sks request timeout" hang cleared** — the T1 keystore
      stack (AppleKeyStore / AppleSSE / AppleCredentialManager + corecrypto_T1 +
      KernelRelayHost) is substituted for the T2 versions, so the boot no longer
      depends on the SEP mailbox handshake that hangs under OpenCore. This is the
      wall that blocks the upstream project.
- [x] **Boots past the SEP to the installer** — reaches WindowServer / the Setup
      Assistant language chooser (VoiceOver active)
- [ ] Internal display renders — currently a grey screen with a live cursor;
      injecting the genuine Intel UHD 617 framebuffer + panel DeviceProperties
      that bridgeOS normally supplies (`AAPL,ig-platform-id`, `AAPL00,PanelPower*`)
- [ ] USB-Map.kext (MacBookAir8,1 / 8,2)
- [ ] Post-install + full OS usability

### How it works (T2 diagnosis)

The failure that blocks T2 Macs upstream is `AppleSEPManager` timing out on
`AppleKeyStore` SKS requests to the Secure Enclave (`AppleSEPManagerIntel.cpp`),
because the T2's SEP is driven over an MMIO + IOMMU + MSI mailbox that does not
survive the OpenCore → `boot.efi` → kernel handoff on these models. Rather than
patch the panic (which only converts it to a silent hang), this fork replaces
the whole keystore stack with the older T1-era kexts, which do not use that
mailbox. A "Save T2 boot diagnostics" button (Developer tab) collects the NVRAM
`preoslog` / panic-info, kernel panic reports, and the OpenCore log + SysReport
for offline analysis.

A Python-based project revolving around [Acidanthera's OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) and [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) for both running and unlocking features in macOS on supported and unsupported Macs.

Our project's main goal is to breathe new life into Macs no longer supported by Apple, allowing for the installation and usage of macOS Big Sur and newer on machines as old as 2007.

----------

Noteworthy features of OpenCore Legacy Patcher:

* Support for macOS Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma and Sequoia
* Native Over the Air (OTA) System Updates
* Supports Penryn and newer Macs
* Full support for WPA Wi-Fi and Personal Hotspot on BCM943224 and newer wireless chipsets
* System Integrity Protection, FileVault 2, .im4m Secure Boot and Vaulting
* Recovery OS, Safe Mode and Single-user Mode booting on non-native OSes
* Unlocks features such as Sidecar and AirPlay to Mac even on native Macs
* Enables enhanced SATA and NVMe power management on non-Apple storage devices
* Zero firmware patching required (ie. APFS ROM patching)
* Graphics acceleration for both Metal and non-Metal GPUs

----------

Note: Only clean-installs and upgrades are supported. macOS Big Sur installs already patched with other patchers, such as [Patched Sur](https://github.com/BenSova/Patched-Sur) or [bigmac](https://github.com/StarPlayrX/bigmac), cannot be used due to broken file integrity with APFS snapshots and SIP.

* You can, however, reinstall macOS with this patcher and retain your original data

Note 2: Currently, OpenCore Legacy Patcher officially supports patching to run macOS Big Sur through Sonoma installs. For older OSes, OpenCore may function; however, support is currently not provided from Dortania.

* For macOS Mojave and Catalina support, we recommend the use of [dosdude1's patchers](http://dosdude1.com)

## Getting Started

To start using the project, please see our in-depth guide:

* [OpenCore Legacy Patcher Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)

### Required: grant this build Full Disk Access

Builds from this fork's CI are **unsigned** — GitHub Actions has no Apple
Developer ID certificate, so `sign_notarize` prints "Signing and Notarization
details not provided, skipping", and the privileged helper is compiled with
`-DDEBUG` to skip its team-ID check (it otherwise only accepts Dortania's signed
app, team `S74BDJXQMD`).

Consequence: macOS applies stricter TCC rules to an unsigned app, so it **cannot
write to USB/external volumes** — every write fails with `Operation not
permitted` (EPERM), and installing OpenCore leaves the EFI partition empty.

Before installing OpenCore to a disk:

1. **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**
2. Turn it **on** for OpenCore Legacy Patcher
3. Quit the app completely (Cmd-Q) and reopen it

The official signed Dortania release does not need this, because its root helper
accepts the signed app and performs the EFI writes itself.

## Support

This project is offered on an AS-IS basis, we do not guarantee support for any issues that may arise. However, there is a community server with other passionate users and developers that can aid you:

* [OpenCore Patcher Paradise Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rqdPgH8xSN)
  * Keep in mind that the Discord server is maintained by the community, so we ask everyone to be respectful.
  * Please review our docs on [how to debug with OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/DEBUG.html) to gather important information to help others with troubleshooting.
